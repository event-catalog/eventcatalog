Add resource docs feature: attach documentation pages (ADRs, runbooks, guides, contracts, etc.) to any resource in the catalog. Resource docs appear in the sidebar under each resource and support versioning, categories, and type grouping. Fixes content collection glob pattern to avoid conflict with customPages.
