title: Teams and Users
description: Define ownership and people metadata with team and user resources.
---

Use `team` and `user` to model ownership and contributor context in your catalog.

## Example

This example defines a user, a team with a member, and then assigns the team as the owner of a service.

```ec title="main.ec"
user dboyne {
  name "David Boyne"
  role "Principal Engineer"
  email "david@company.com"
  slack "https://company.slack.com/team/U12345"
}

team platform-team {
  name "Platform Team"
  summary "Owns platform-level architecture and standards"
  email "platform@company.com"
  slack "https://company.slack.com/channels/platform-team"
  member dboyne
}

service OrdersService {
  version 1.0.0
  owner platform-team
}
```
