domain Commerce {
  version 1.0.0
  name "Commerce Domain"
  summary "Order and payment capabilities"
  owner commerce-team

  service OrdersService {
    version 1.0.0
    sends event OrderCreated@1.0.0
  }

  subdomain Payments {
    version 1.0.0
    service PaymentService {
      version 1.0.0
      receives event OrderCreated@1.0.0
    }
  }
}
```
