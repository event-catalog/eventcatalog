## Example

This example defines a Kafka channel and shows a service sending an event through that channel.

```ec title="main.ec"
channel OrdersChannel {
  version 1.0.0
  name "Orders Channel"
  summary "Carries order events"
  protocol "Kafka"
  address "orders.events.v1"
  owner platform-team
  route AnalyticsChannel@1.0.0
}

service OrdersService {
  version 1.0.0
  sends event OrderCreated@1.0.0 to OrdersChannel@1.0.0
}
```
