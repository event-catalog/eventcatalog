If this is your first time with EventCatalog Modeling, this tutorial is for you.

In this tutorial, we will build a tiny architecture model from scratch and see it visually.

To start, open a [blank EventCatalog Modelling workspace](https://playground.eventcatalog.dev/) in a new tab.

Then walk through these steps:

## Creating your first model

In this example we will create a simple model of an order processing system.

<Steps>

1. ### Create a service

   A service is a runtime capability in your system, example a microservice or application.
   - Start by creating a service
   - In this example, we create a service called `OrdersService`.

   ```diff lang=ec
   +service OrdersService {
   +  version 1.0.0
   +  name "Orders Service"
   +  summary "Handles order lifecycle"
   +}
   ```

2. ### Create an event

   Events are immutable facts about something that happened in the system.
   - Next we model an event. An immutable fact.
   - In this example we create an event called `OrderCreated`.

   ```diff lang=ec
   service OrdersService {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Orders Service"
     summary "Handles order lifecycle"
   }

   +event OrderCreated {
   +  version 1.0.0
   +  name "Order Created"
   +  summary "Raised when an order is created"
   +}
   ```

3. ### Publish the event from the service

   Services can `send` (publish) messages. These can be events, commands, or queries.
   These messages can be send `to` a channel (e.g. Kafka, MQTT, HTTP, SQS, etc.).
   - Next we connect the service to the event.
   - We specify in this example, that the `OrdersService` sends (publishes) the `OrderCreated` event
   - We also specify a channel to send the event to (e.g. Kafka, MQTT, HTTP, SQS, etc.) (_this is optional_)

   ```diff lang=ec
   service OrdersService {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Orders Service"
     summary "Handles order lifecycle"
   +  sends event OrderCreated@1.0.0 to KafkaOrdersTopic
   }

   event OrderCreated {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Order Created"
     summary "Raised when an order is created"
   }

   +channel KafkaOrdersTopic {
   +  version 1.0.0
   +  name "Kafka Orders Topic"
   +  summary "Primary channel for order events"
   +  address "orders.events"
   +  protocol "kafka"
   +}
   ```

4. ### Consume messages by the service

   Services can also `receive` (consume) messages. These can be events, commands, or queries.
   These messages can be received `from` a channel (e.g. Kafka, MQTT, HTTP, SQS, etc.).
   - Next we model the messages received by the service.
   - In this example we create a command called `ProcessOrder`.
   - This time we don't specify a version and latest version is used.

   ```diff lang=ec
   service OrdersService {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Orders Service"
     summary "Handles order lifecycle"
     sends event OrderCreated@1.0.0 to KafkaOrdersTopic
   +  receives command ProcessOrder
   }

   event OrderCreated {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Order Created"
     summary "Raised when an order is created"
   }

   channel KafkaOrdersTopic {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Kafka Orders Topic"
     summary "Primary channel for order events"
     address "orders.events"
     protocol "kafka"
   }

   +command ProcessOrder {
   +  version 1.0.0
   +  name "Process Order"
   +  summary "Processes an order"
   +}
   ```

5. ### Visualize the model

   Now we use the `visualizer` block to visualize all or part of the model.
   - Here we visualize the service.
   - All connections to the service are visualized for us.

   ```diff lang=ec
   service OrdersService {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Orders Service"
     summary "Handles order lifecycle"
     sends event OrderCreated@1.0.0 to KafkaOrdersTopic
     receives command ProcessOrder
   }

   event OrderCreated {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Order Created"
     summary "Raised when an order is created"
   }

   channel KafkaOrdersTopic {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Kafka Orders Topic"
     summary "Primary channel for order events"
     address "orders.events"
     protocol "kafka"
   }

   command ProcessOrder {
     version 1.0.0
     name "Process Order"
     summary "Processes an order"
   }

   +visualizer main {
   +  name "Quickstart View"
   +  service OrdersService@1.0.0
   +}
   ```

6. ### Next steps
   - Import your model into docs: [Import models to EventCatalog](/guides/importing-ec/)
   - Export docs back to models: [Export EventCatalog to models](/guides/exporting-ec/)
   - Design future-state systems: [Designing target architectures](/guides/designing-target-architectures/)
   - Capture review decisions: [Getting feedback from designs](/guides/getting-feedback-from-designs/)
     </Steps>
