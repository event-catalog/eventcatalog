title: Notes
description: Capture design feedback and open questions with @note annotations.
---

Use `@note` to attach review context directly to models. Notes are repeatable, so you can add multiple notes to the same resource.

> The keyword is `@note` (singular), even if you are adding many notes.

## Example

```ec title="main.ec"
service CheckoutService {
  version 2.0.0
  owner checkout-team

  @note("Should retries live here or in PaymentsService?")
  @note("Need SRE sign-off for timeout policy", author: "platform-team", priority: "high")

  sends event CheckoutSubmitted@2.0.0 to CheckoutEvents@1.0.0
}
```

## Parameters

| Parameter      | Type   | Required | Description                       | Example               |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| first argument | string | Yes      | The note text.                    | `"Need SRE sign-off"` |
| `author`       | string | No       | Person or team who left the note. | `"platform-team"`     |
| `priority`     | string | No       | Priority label for triage.        | `"high"`              |

## Where you can use notes

- messages (`event`, `command`, `query`)
- channels
- inline messages inside `sends` and `receives`
