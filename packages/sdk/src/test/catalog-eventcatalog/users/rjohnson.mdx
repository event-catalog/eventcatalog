I'm a UX Designer on the Design Systems team, passionate about creating intuitive and accessible user experiences. With a background in cognitive psychology and human-computer interaction, I focus on user research, wireframing, and prototyping. I collaborate closely with product teams to ensure our solutions meet both user needs and business objectives.
