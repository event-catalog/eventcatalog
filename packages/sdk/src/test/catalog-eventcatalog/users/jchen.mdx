As a DevOps Engineer on the Platform Engineering team, I specialize in building and maintaining our cloud infrastructure and deployment pipelines. My focus is on automating processes, improving system reliability, and ensuring smooth continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). I work closely with development teams to streamline their workflows and implement robust monitoring and alerting solutions.
