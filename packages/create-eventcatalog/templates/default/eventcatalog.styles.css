Stylesheet overrides for EventCatalog. 
There is currently a limit on what can be changed. 

If you want to override some styles of particular elements, raise an issue for discussion. (https://github.com/boyney123/eventcatalog)

Note: Override based on custom selectors / hacks at your own risk. EventCatalog selectors will change over time, which may break your styles.
      use the styles marked with `ec-` for non breaking styling changes.
