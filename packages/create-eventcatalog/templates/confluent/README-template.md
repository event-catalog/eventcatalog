# My Confluent Event Catalog

Welcome to your new Confluent Event Catalog!

Getting started:

1. Edit the `.env` file to configure your environment variables.
1. Run Confluent Cloud locally, or configure your `schemaRegistryUrl` in the `eventcatalog.config.js` file
1. Run `npm run generate` to import your schemas from confluent schema registry.
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
1. Go to localhost:3000 to view your catalog.

### What else can you do?

With the Confluent Schema Registry integration you can :

- Document your schemas, topics
- Assign your schemas to producers and consumers
- Assign resources to users and teams in your organization
- Visualize your Kafka architecture
- Add semantic meaning to your schemas and topics
- And much more!

The easiest way to get started and dive deeper is to read the [Event Catalog documentation](https://eventcatalog.dev/docs/plugins/confluent-schema-registry/intro).
