# Introduction

‚ö°Ô∏è EventCatalog will help you document your Event-Driven architecture in no time.

‚ö°Ô∏è EventCatalog is designed to help you document and capture your Events, Services, Domains, Schemas, Code Examples and much more. 

‚ö°Ô∏è Ease of use, developer experience and managing maintenance overhead is key to this project. That's why we try to focus on simplifying the experience.


## Motivation

**Event-Driven Architectures** have been around for awhile now, but it‚Äôs becoming more accessible with things like serverless offerings it is now easier now more than ever to get started.

Event Architectures are proving they can give some great benefits but parts of the ecosystem still need to be improved.

Over the past decade we have seen tools like [EventStorming](https://www.eventstorming.com/) and [EventModeling](https://eventmodeling.org/posts/what-is-event-modeling/) take off. These practises encourage us to talk and design our Events **together**. 

Shared understanding and context goes into the creation of our Events, Bounded Context and Services but unfortunately this information get's lost over time.

Our community is starting to look into Event Discovery and documentation. Many brokers have **Schema Registrys** but can we do more?

What if we could:

- Document our Services and Schemas
- Describe Events and see the history of Events
- Group Services and Events by domains
- Create interactive interfaces for us to explore our events, bounded contexts and more...

Say hello to **EventCatalog**.

**EventCatalog is designed to help people understand, document and discover their Event Architectures.**

EventCatalog is not locked down to any technology or brokers. It has been designed to be extendable, easy to use and maintain, supporting plugins, documentation generators, multiple schema formats and much more.

We can do so much more for our Event Architectures.

EventCatalog is Open Source and hopefully it can add value to your teams.
