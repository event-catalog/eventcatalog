# Introduction

‚ö°Ô∏è EventCatlog will help you document your Event-Driven architecture in no time.

‚ö°Ô∏è EventCatalog is powered by Markdown files. Ease of use and developer experience and managing maintenance overhead is key to this project. That's why we try to focus on simplifying the experience.

üí• Ready for more? Use advanced features like versioning, changelogs, 3D node graphs and more...

üßê EventCatalog is a NextJS application under the hood which users the server to get your files. This allows us to leverage all sorts of API's and future features we may want to explore. Most of this is abstracted away allowing you to focus just on the markdown files that power EventCatalog.
