### `<Schema />`

Supported in 
- event markdown files

This component will render your schema to the document. To make this work you will need to add a `schema` file into your event directory.

For more information check out the [schema guide for events](/docs/events/adding-schemas).

### `<Mermaid />`


This component will render [mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) into your documents.

If you use `<Mermaid />` without any props EventCatalog will render the relationships between your consumers and producers.

If you would like to **render custom** mermaid diagrams you can use the `charts` prop on the diagram.

Read [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) if you want to learn what other graphs you can render.

- event markdown files
- service markdown files
