**Events** are a core part of any Event Driven Architecture.

### What do events look like in EventCatalog?

![Event Example](/img/guides/events/Event.png)

**EventCatalog** provides many features when documenting your events:

- **Schema** - Renders code snippets of your Schemas (Supports any schema)
- **Code Examples** - Give developers code examples of how to use your Events (Supports any language)
- **Owners** - Document owners of your events so teams know who owns what
- **Producers** - Document producers of your events
- **Consumers** - Document consumers of your events
- **Versions** - Version your event, schema, and more!
