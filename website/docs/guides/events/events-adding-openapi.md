With EventCatalog you can add your OpenAPI Specifications to your events.

To use the feature you will need to do two things:

1. Add your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file into your event
    - example `/events/{Your Event}/openapi.yaml`
2. Add the Component [OpenAPI](/docs/components/overview#openapi-) inside your event markdown file.

This will load your OpenAPI file into your Event Page.

## OpenAPI Schema

OpenAPI schema for the event can be found below.

<OpenAPI  />

```

### Props for Component

The `<OpenAPI/>` component uses [swagger-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-react) under the hood. If you want to configure your component you can pass these props into your component.

```mdx title="Example of passing through props from swagger-ui-react"
<OpenAPI docExpansion="full"  />
```
