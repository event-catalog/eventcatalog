## Adding Services to your EventCatalog

You will find all services within the `/services` directory.

To add a new service you will need to create a new folder with your service name and an `index.md` file inside that folder.

- `/services/{Service Name}/index.md` 
  - (example `/services/Email Platform/index.md`)

Once you create your new file you will need to fill it with the service front-matter data and markdown content. 

**There are two parts to the service data**

1. [service configuration (frontmatter)](/docs/api/event-frontmatter)
2. [content (markdown)](#example)

Fill in the details of your service and run the Catalog. You will see all your services and will be able to navigate around and explore them!

:::tip
When you define your `producers` or `consumers` in your events the name has to match your Service folder name.

For example if you define a `producer` in your event called `Email Platform` your service folder name will have to be `Email Platform` (space included)
:::


## Example of adding a Service {#example}

Let's add a new service called **Email Platform**.

Create a new folder in the `/services/` directory called `Email Platform`, then add your `index.md` to that folder.

For example: `/services/Email Platform/index.md`

Copy the contents below into your new file.

```mdx title="/services/Email Platform/index.md"

Once done, run the EventCatalog and navigate to your new event [localhost:3000/services/Email%20Platform](http://localhost:3000/services/Email%20Platform)

You should now see your new service!

**Well done. You created your first service** ðŸŽ‰.
