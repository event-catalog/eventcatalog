**Domains** are a core part of any Event Driven Architecture.

EventCatalog allows you to group your [events](/docs/events/introduction) and [services](/docs/services/introduction) by your application domains.

Using **domains** in EventCatalog gives you a better way to manage your events and services and define their bounded context.
