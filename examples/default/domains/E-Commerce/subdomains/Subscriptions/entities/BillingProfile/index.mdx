## Overview

The BillingProfile entity consolidates billing-specific details for a customer, such as the billing address, contact email for invoices, tax information, and potentially preferred payment methods. This might be distinct from the customer's general contact information or shipping addresses.

### Entity Properties
<EntityPropertiesTable />

## Relationships

*   **Customer:** A billing profile belongs to one `Customer`. A customer might potentially have multiple profiles in complex scenarios, but often just one.
*   **Address:** Linked to a primary billing `Address`.
*   **PaymentMethod:** May specify a preferred `PaymentMethod`.
*   **Invoice:** Invoices are typically generated using information from the BillingProfile.
*   **Subscription:** Subscriptions may use the associated customer's BillingProfile for charging.

## Examples

*   Jane Doe's personal billing profile with her home address and primary email.
*   Acme Corp's billing profile with their HQ address, VAT ID, and accounts payable email address.
