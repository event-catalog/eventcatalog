## Overview

The Billing Service is responsible for managing all billing-related operations for subscriptions. It calculates billing cycles, generates invoices, and coordinates with payment services to ensure timely payment collection.

## Key Features

- **Billing Cycle Management**: Handles daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual billing cycles
- **Invoice Generation**: Creates detailed invoices with line items and tax calculations
- **Payment Scheduling**: Schedules recurring payments based on billing cycles
- **Proration**: Calculates prorated charges for mid-cycle changes
- **Dunning Management**: Handles failed payment retry logic

## API Endpoints

### REST API
- `GET /api/billing/invoice/{subscriptionId}` - Get current invoice
- `GET /api/billing/history/{subscriptionId}` - Get billing history
- `POST /api/billing/preview` - Preview upcoming charges
- `PUT /api/billing/retry/{invoiceId}` - Retry failed payment
