## Overview

The CartItem entity represents individual products within a customer's shopping cart. It maintains snapshots of product information and pricing to ensure consistency during the shopping session.

### Entity Properties
<EntityPropertiesTable />

## Relationships

* **ShoppingCart:** Each cart item belongs to one `ShoppingCart` (identified by `cartId`).
* **Product:** Each cart item references one `Product` (identified by `productId`).

## Price Calculations

* **Total Price** = Quantity × Unit Price - Discount Amount
* **Savings** = Original Price - Unit Price (if applicable)

## Examples

* **CartItem #1:** iPhone 15 Pro, quantity 1, $999.99 unit price, no discount.
* **CartItem #2:** Running Shoes Size 9, quantity 2, $64.99 unit price (was $129.99).
* **CartItem #3:** T-Shirt Large/Blue, quantity 3, $19.99 unit price.

## Business Rules

* Quantity must be greater than zero
* Unit price is captured at time of adding to maintain consistency
* Product availability is checked when cart is accessed
* Unavailable items are marked but not automatically removed
* Total price is recalculated when quantity changes
* Product snapshots prevent price changes from affecting active carts
* Maximum quantity limits may apply per product type
