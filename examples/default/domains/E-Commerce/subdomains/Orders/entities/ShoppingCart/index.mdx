## Overview

The ShoppingCart entity manages the customer's shopping experience before checkout. It tracks selected products, quantities, pricing, and supports both registered customer and guest shopping scenarios.

### Entity Properties
<EntityPropertiesTable />

## Relationships

* **Customer:** A cart can belong to one `Customer` (identified by `customerId`).
* **CartItem:** A cart contains multiple `CartItem` entities with product details.
* **Address:** A cart can reference shipping and billing `Address` entities.
* **Order:** A cart can be converted to one `Order` (identified by `convertedToOrderId`).

## Cart States

```
active → abandoned
   ↓       ↓
converted  expired
```

## Examples

* **Cart #1:** Customer cart with 3 items, $299.99 total, active status.
* **Cart #2:** Guest cart abandoned after 24 hours, contains 1 high-value item.
* **Cart #3:** Converted cart that became Order #12345, marked as converted.

## Business Rules

* Guest carts are identified by session ID when customer ID is null
* Cart totals are recalculated when items are added/removed
* Abandoned carts trigger marketing automation after configured time
* Expired carts are cleaned up after retention period
* Cart conversion creates an order and marks cart as converted
* Inventory is not reserved until checkout begins
* Applied coupons are validated on each cart update
* Cart items maintain snapshot of product prices at time of addition
