## Overview

The Order entity captures all details related to a customer's purchase request. It serves as the central aggregate root within the Orders domain, coordinating information about the customer, products ordered, payment, and shipping.

### Entity Properties

## Relationships

*   **Customer:** Each order belongs to one `Customer` (identified by `customerId`).
*   **OrderItem:** An order contains one or more `OrderItem` entities detailing the specific products and quantities.
*   **Payment:** An order is typically associated with a `Payment` entity (not detailed here).
*   **Shipment:** An order may lead to one or more `Shipment` entities (not detailed here).

## Examples

*   **Order #12345:** A customer orders 2 units of Product A and 1 unit of Product B, to be shipped to their home address. Status is 'Processing'.
*   **Order #67890:** A customer places a large order for multiple items, requiring special shipping arrangements. Status is 'Pending' until payment confirmation.
