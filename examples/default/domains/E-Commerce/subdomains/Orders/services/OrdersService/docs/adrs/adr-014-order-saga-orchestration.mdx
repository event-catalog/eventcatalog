## Context

Order placement spans inventory reservation, payment processing, and customer notification.
When one step fails, we need deterministic rollback behavior and an auditable flow.

## Decision

OrdersService acts as the saga orchestrator for order placement:

- emits `OrderConfirmed` only after inventory + payment succeed
- emits compensating actions (e.g. inventory release) on downstream failure
- tracks saga state with explicit step transitions for observability

## Consequences

- Better consistency for cross-service workflows.
- Easier incident debugging with a single orchestration timeline.
- Slightly tighter coupling to workflow policy inside OrdersService.
