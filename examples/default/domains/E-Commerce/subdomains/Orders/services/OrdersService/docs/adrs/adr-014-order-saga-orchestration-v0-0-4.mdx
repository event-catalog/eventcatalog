## Context

We observed repeated confusion around retry boundaries and compensation ownership across downstream services.

## Decision

OrdersService remains the saga orchestrator and must:

- persist explicit step state transitions
- enforce idempotent compensation handlers
- emit operational markers for each transition
- stop retries once compensation begins

## Consequences

- More predictable failure handling.
- Improved observability and postmortems.
- Slightly more orchestration complexity.
