# Runbook-010: Stuck Orders Recovery

## Symptoms

- Orders remain in pending state for >10 minutes
- Missing `OrderConfirmed` events
- Spike in compensation/retry activity

## Steps

1. Identify affected order IDs and common failing step.
2. Verify inventory reservation state.
3. Verify payment state and duplicate charge risk.
4. Trigger safe replay using idempotent reprocessor.
5. Validate customer notification and fulfillment state.

## Rollback / Escalation

Escalate to payment + inventory owners if mismatched state persists after replay.
