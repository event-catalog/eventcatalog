## Overview

The `ShipmentDelivered` event is emitted when a shipment is delivered. It provides information such as the shipment status (e.g., pending, completed, shipped), the items within the shipment, billing and shipping details, payment information, and the order's total amount. This query is commonly used by systems managing order processing, customer service, or order tracking functionalities.

This event can be applied in e-commerce systems, marketplaces, or any platform where users and systems need real-time shipment data for tracking, auditing, or managing customer purchases.
