### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Ensure that only authenticated users can initiate a payment, and the userId in the payload matches the authenticated user.
- **Data Validation**: Validate all input data to prevent injection attacks or other malicious input.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Avoid including sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers) in the event payload. Use secure channels and encryption for such data.
