## Overview

The Fraud Detection Service is responsible for analyzing payment transactions in real-time to detect potential fraudulent activity. It uses machine learning models and rule-based systems to assess risk and prevent financial losses.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Transaction Analysis**: Analyzes transactions as they occur
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses ML to identify suspicious patterns
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates risk scores for each transaction
- **Automated Blocking**: Can automatically block high-risk transactions
- **Manual Review Queue**: Flags medium-risk transactions for manual review

## API Endpoints

### REST API
- `POST /api/fraud/check` - Submit transaction for fraud check
- `GET /api/fraud/risk-score/{transactionId}` - Get risk score for transaction
- `PUT /api/fraud/override/{transactionId}` - Manual override of fraud decision
