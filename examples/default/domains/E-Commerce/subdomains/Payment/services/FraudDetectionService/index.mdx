## Overview

The Fraud Detection Service is responsible for analyzing payment transactions in real-time to detect potential fraudulent activity. It is part of the [[domain|Payment]] domain and works alongside [[service|PaymentService]] and [[service|PaymentGatewayService]].

The service receives [[event|PaymentInitiated]] events and publishes [[event|FraudCheckCompleted]], [[event|FraudDetected]], and [[event|RiskScoreCalculated]] events based on its analysis.
