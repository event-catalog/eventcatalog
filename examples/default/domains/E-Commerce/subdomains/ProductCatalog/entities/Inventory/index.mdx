## Overview

The Inventory entity manages stock levels and availability for products in the e-commerce system. It tracks current quantities, reserved stock, and provides reorder management capabilities.

### Entity Properties
<EntityPropertiesTable />

## Relationships

* **Product:** Each inventory record belongs to one `Product` (identified by `productId`).
* **OrderItem:** Inventory quantities are affected by `OrderItem` entities when orders are placed.

## Stock Calculations

* **Available Quantity** = Quantity On Hand - Quantity Reserved
* **Reorder Needed** = Quantity Available &lt;= Reorder Point
* **Stock Value** = Quantity On Hand Ã— Unit Cost

## Examples

* **Inventory #1:** iPhone 15 Pro - 25 on hand, 5 reserved, 20 available, reorder at 10 units.
* **Inventory #2:** Running Shoes Size 9 - 0 on hand, 2 reserved, backorder allowed.

## Business Rules

* Quantity on hand cannot be negative
* Quantity reserved cannot exceed quantity on hand
* Available quantity is automatically calculated
* Reorder alerts are triggered when available = reorder point
* Stock reservations are created when orders are placed
* Stock is decremented when orders are shipped
* Inventory adjustments must be logged for audit trail
