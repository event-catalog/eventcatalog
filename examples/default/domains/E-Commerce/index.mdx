## Target Architecture (Event Storming Results)

Our target architecture was defined through collaborative event storming sessions with product, engineering, and business stakeholders. This represents our vision for FlowMart's commerce capabilities.

## Target Architecture (Lucid Chart)

First we used Lucid to create a detailed target architecture diagram, but moved to use EventStorming results for the final target architecture.

Here is a reference to the Lucid diagram for the target architecture:
