## Core Domains for E-Commerce

The <ResourceLink id="Orders" type="domain">Orders</ResourceLink> and <ResourceLink id="Subscriptions" type="domain">Subscription</ResourceLink> domains are core domains for the E-Commerce domain.

<span class="not-prose">They are used to manage the orders and subscriptions for the E-Commerce domain.</span>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-prose">
  <NodeGraph id="Orders" version="0.0.3" type="domain" />
  <NodeGraph id="Subscriptions" version="0.0.1" type="domain" />
</div>

The E-Commerce domain is built on the following sub domains:

- <ResourceLink id="Orders" type="domain">Orders</ResourceLink> - Core domain for order management
- <ResourceLink id="Payment" type="domain">Payment</ResourceLink> - A generic domain for payment processing using Stripe as a payment provider
- <ResourceLink id="Subscriptions" type="domain">Subscription</ResourceLink> - Generic subscription domain handling users subscriptions


### FlowMart E-Commerce Database Schema

This diagram represents the core relational data model behind FlowMart, a fictional event-driven e-commerce platform. It captures the main business entities and their relationships, including customers, orders, products, inventory events, and payments.

The schema is designed to support a distributed microservices architecture with event-sourced patterns, enabling services like OrderService, InventoryService, and PaymentService to operate independently while maintaining data consistency through asynchronous events.

## Target Architecture (Event Storming Results)

Our target architecture was defined through collaborative event storming sessions with product, engineering, and business stakeholders. This represents our vision for FlowMart's commerce capabilities.
