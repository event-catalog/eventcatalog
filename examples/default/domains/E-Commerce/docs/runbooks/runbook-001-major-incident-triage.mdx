# Runbook-001: Major Incident Triage

## Trigger

Use this runbook when checkout availability drops, payments fail broadly, or order events stop flowing.

## Steps

1. Confirm blast radius (domains, services, user journeys).
2. Identify first failing dependency from logs/metrics.
3. Stabilize critical path (checkout + payment + confirmation).
4. Declare ownership and comms cadence.
5. Record timeline and remediation in postmortem.

## Exit Criteria

- Error rates back to baseline
- Order confirmations flowing normally
- Incident summary shared with stakeholders
