# Domain Boundary Guidelines

## Principle

Model ownership around business capability and decision autonomy, not around API shape.

## Heuristics

- If it decides **how to collect money**, it belongs to Payment.
- If it decides **what is being purchased and fulfilled**, it belongs to Orders.
- If it decides **recurring entitlement/lifecycle**, it belongs to Subscriptions.

## Anti-patterns

- Reusing domain events as internal RPC
- Cross-domain writes without explicit contract/versioning
- Shared mutable ownership of the same aggregate
