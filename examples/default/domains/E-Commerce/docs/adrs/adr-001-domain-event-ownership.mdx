# ADR-001: Domain Event Ownership

## Status
Accepted

## Context

As the E-Commerce domain grew, event names started overlapping between subdomains (Orders, Payment, and Subscriptions).
This made it unclear which team owned contract changes and compatibility guarantees.

## Decision

- Each event contract is owned by the bounded context that emits it.
- Upstream producers own schema versioning and changelog updates.
- Downstream consumers must tolerate additive changes.
- Breaking changes require a new event version and migration guidance.

## Consequences

- Clear ownership and faster review paths.
- Better confidence when evolving event schemas.
- Slight increase in process overhead for breaking changes.
