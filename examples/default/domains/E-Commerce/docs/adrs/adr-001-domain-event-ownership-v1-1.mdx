## Context

As teams scaled independently, we needed clearer boundaries for schema compatibility and deprecation timelines.

## Decision

- Producers own event schema lifecycle and changelogs.
- Consumers must support additive changes by default.
- Breaking changes require a new version and migration notes.
- Ownership is tied to the emitting bounded context team.

## Consequences

- Better cross-team contract clarity.
- Fewer accidental breaking changes.
- More explicit release discipline around message evolution.
