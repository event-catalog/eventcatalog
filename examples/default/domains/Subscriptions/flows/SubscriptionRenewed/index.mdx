## Subscription Renewal Flow

This flow documents the process of automatic subscription renewals, including handling various edge cases such as payment failures, expired subscriptions, and customer interactions.

<NodeGraph />

### Key Components

* **Automatic Renewal Process**: Triggered by a scheduled timer when the subscription renewal period is reached
* **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment gateway and handling of payment failures
* **Customer Notifications**: Various notifications sent throughout the process
* **Grace Period Handling**: Special handling when payments fail with a grace period before subscription suspension
* **Usage Analytics**: Analysis of customer usage patterns to identify upgrade opportunities

### Business Rules

1. Subscriptions are renewed automatically unless explicitly canceled
2. Failed payments trigger a retry process (up to 3 attempts)
3. Customers receive a 7-day grace period before subscription suspension
4. Usage patterns are analyzed to provide personalized upgrade recommendations
