## Overview

The PaymentMethod entity represents a specific payment instrument registered by a customer, such as a credit card or a linked bank account. It stores necessary (non-sensitive) details required to initiate payments and links to the associated customer and billing address.

**Security Note:** Sensitive details like full card numbers or bank account numbers should **never** be stored directly. Rely on tokenization provided by payment gateways.
