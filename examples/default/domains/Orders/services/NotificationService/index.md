## Overview

It supports various notification channels such as email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app notifications. The service ensures reliable and timely delivery of messages and integrates with other services to trigger notifications based on specific events.

## Infrastructure

The Notification Service is hosted on AWS.

The diagram below shows the infrastructure of the Notification Service. The service is hosted on AWS and uses AWS Lambda to handle the notification requests. The notification is stored in an AWS Aurora database and the notification metadata is stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(logos:aws)

    service db(logos:aws-aurora)[Notification DB] in api
    service disk1(logos:aws-s3)[Notification Metadata] in api
    service server(logos:aws-lambda)[Notification Handler] in api

    db:L -- R:server
    disk1:T -- B:server
```

You can find more information about the Notification Service infrastructure in the [Notification Service documentation](https://github.com/event-catalog/pretend-shipping-service/blob/main/README.md).
