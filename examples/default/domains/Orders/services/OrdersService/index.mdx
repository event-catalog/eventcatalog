## Infrastructure

The Orders Service is hosted on AWS.

The diagram below shows the infrastructure of the Orders Service. The service is hosted on AWS and uses AWS Lambda to handle the order requests. The order is stored in an AWS Aurora database and the order metadata is stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(logos:aws)

    service db(logos:aws-aurora)[Order DB] in api
    service disk1(logos:aws-s3)[Order Metadata] in api
    service server(logos:aws-lambda)[Order Handler] in api

    db:L -- R:server
    disk1:T -- B:server
```

You can find more information about the Orders Service infrastructure in the [Orders Service documentation](https://github.com/event-catalog/pretend-shipping-service/blob/main/README.md).
