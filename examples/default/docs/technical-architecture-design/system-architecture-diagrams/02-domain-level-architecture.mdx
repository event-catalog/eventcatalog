# FlowMart Domain-Level Architecture

This document describes the domain-level architecture of the FlowMart e-commerce platform, showing how different domains interact with each other through well-defined interfaces and events.

## Domain Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the bounded contexts of each domain and how they communicate with each other:

## Domain Descriptions

### Orders Domain
The Orders Domain is the central domain of our e-commerce platform. It manages the entire lifecycle of customer orders, from creation to fulfillment. It communicates with other domains to check inventory availability, process payments, and arrange shipping.

**Key Events Published:**
- OrderConfirmed
- OrderCancelled 
- OrderAmended

**Commands:**
- PlaceOrder

**Queries:**
- GetOrder

### Inventory Domain
The Inventory Domain manages product stock levels across all warehouses. It ensures accurate inventory tracking and provides real-time stock information to other domains.

**Key Events Published:**
- InventoryAdjusted
- OutOfStock

**Commands:**
- AddInventory
- UpdateInventory
- DeleteInventory

**Queries:**
- GetInventoryStatus
- GetInventoryList

### Payment Domain
The Payment Domain handles all financial transactions within the platform. It processes customer payments, manages refunds, and communicates with external payment gateways.

**Key Events Published:**
- PaymentProcessed

**Commands:**
- PaymentInitiated

**Queries:**
- GetPaymentStatus

### Shipping Domain
The Shipping Domain manages order delivery to customers. It tracks shipment status, handles returns, and integrates with external logistics providers.

**Key Events Published:**
- ShipmentCreated
- ShipmentDispatched
- ShipmentInTransit
- ShipmentDelivered
- DeliveryFailed
- ReturnInitiated

**Commands:**

- CancelSubscription

**Queries:**
- GetSubscriptionStatus

### Notification Domain
The Notification Domain is responsible for sending notifications to customers through various channels like email, SMS, and push notifications.

**Queries:**
- GetUserNotifications
- GetNotificationDetails

## Domain Integration Patterns

The domains in FlowMart's architecture interact using several integration patterns:

1. **Event-Driven Communication**: Most domain interactions occur through asynchronous events published to a message broker, promoting loose coupling.

2. **Synchronous API Calls**: For operations requiring immediate responses, domains expose REST APIs that can be called synchronously.

3. **Saga Pattern**: For complex workflows spanning multiple domains, we use choreography-based sagas where services respond to events to maintain data consistency.

4. **CQRS**: We separate command (write) and query (read) operations, allowing for optimization of each path.
