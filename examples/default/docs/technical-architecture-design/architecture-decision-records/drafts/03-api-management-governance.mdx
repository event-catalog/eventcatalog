## ADR-009: API Management and Governance Strategy

### Status

Draft (Last Updated: 2024-10-07)

### Context

As we expand our microservices architecture for the FlowMart e-commerce platform, we need a comprehensive approach to API management and governance. We are facing several challenges with our current approach to APIs:

1. **Proliferation of APIs**: With our transition to microservices, we anticipate having 50+ internal APIs and multiple external-facing APIs within the next year.

2. **Inconsistent Design Patterns**: Teams are implementing APIs with inconsistent patterns, naming conventions, error handling, and response formats.

3. **Documentation Gaps**: API documentation is inconsistent, often outdated, and frequently exists only in code comments or team wikis.

4. **Discoverability Issues**: Developers struggle to find existing APIs, leading to duplication of functionality.

5. **Security Concerns**: APIs lack consistent security controls, authentication mechanisms, and authorization models.

6. **Version Management**: No clear strategy for versioning APIs, handling breaking changes, or maintaining backward compatibility.

7. **Performance Visibility**: Limited visibility into API performance, usage patterns, and availability.

8. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Features like rate limiting, caching, and observability are implemented inconsistently across services.

9. **Developer Experience**: Onboarding to consume APIs is complex and time-consuming, both for internal teams and external partners.

FlowMart is transitioning from a monolithic architecture to microservices, with a growing ecosystem of APIs. We need a cohesive approach to ensure these APIs are secure, discoverable, consistent, and manageable at scale.

### Decision

We will implement a comprehensive **API Management and Governance Strategy** with the following key components:

1. **API Gateway Architecture**:
   - Implement Kong as our primary API gateway for both internal and external APIs
   - Deploy separate gateway instances for external, internal, and partner traffic
   - Utilize a mesh pattern for internal service-to-service communication
   - Implement a Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern for frontend-specific aggregation

2. **API Design Standards**:
   - Adopt OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) as our API specification standard
   - Establish comprehensive REST API design guidelines
   - Implement a design-first approach for all new APIs
   - Define standard patterns for resource naming, query parameters, pagination, filtering, and error responses
   - Standardize on JSON:API specification for response formatting

3. **API Lifecycle Management**:
   - Define clear stages: Design → Review → Development → Testing → Deployment → Deprecation → Retirement
   - Implement automated API contract testing in CI/CD pipelines
   - Require specification update for any API changes
   - Establish deprecation and sunsetting policies with clear timelines

4. **API Governance Model**:
   - Create an API Guild with representatives from each team
   - Establish an API review process for all new APIs and significant changes
   - Implement automated linting and compliance checking against standards
   - Define metrics for API quality and compliance
   - Regular review of API portfolio for duplication and consolidation opportunities

5. **API Documentation and Discovery**:
   - Deploy a central API developer portal using Backstage
   - Ensure all APIs have OpenAPI specifications
   - Implement automated documentation generation from OpenAPI specs
   - Create a searchable API catalog with metadata, ownership, and usage examples
   - Develop interactive API playground environments

6. **API Security Framework**:
   - Standardize on OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication
   - Implement role-based and attribute-based access control
   - Deploy centralized API key management
   - Establish security scanning and penetration testing for APIs
   - Implement API request validation based on schemas

7. **API Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Deploy comprehensive API metrics collection
   - Create dashboards for performance, availability, and usage
   - Implement distributed tracing for end-to-end request flows
   - Set up alerting on API SLOs and error rates
   - Establish usage analytics for product and developer experience improvement

8. **API Versioning Strategy**:
   - Adopt semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) for all APIs
   - Support at least one previous major version for backward compatibility
   - Use URI versioning for major versions (/v1/, /v2/)
   - Implement feature flags for progressive rollout of API changes
   - Establish clear communication channels for API changes

### API Design Principles

Our API design will adhere to the following principles:

1. **Resource-Oriented Design**: Model APIs around business resources rather than operations.

2. **Consistency**: APIs should behave consistently across the platform.

3. **Least Privilege**: APIs should request only the permissions they need.

4. **Robustness**: APIs should handle error cases gracefully and provide clear error messages.

5. **Forward Compatibility**: Design APIs to be extended without breaking existing clients.

6. **Discoverability**: APIs should be self-documenting and easily discoverable.

7. **Performance**: APIs should be designed with performance considerations in mind.

8. **Security by Design**: Security should be considered at every stage of the API lifecycle.

### API Governance Model

Our API governance model follows these principles:

1. **Federated Ownership**: Teams own their APIs but follow central standards.

2. **Standards over Rules**: Prefer guidance and patterns over strict enforcement.

3. **Automated Compliance**: Automate standards checking wherever possible.

4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and refine standards based on feedback.

5. **Value-Driven**: Focus governance efforts on high-value, high-risk APIs.

6. **Developer Experience**: Prioritize developer experience in governance decisions.

7. **Transparency**: Make governance processes and decisions transparent to all teams.

### Considered Alternatives

#### 1. Decentralized API Management

**Pros**: Maximum team autonomy, reduced coordination overhead  
**Cons**: Inconsistent developer experience, potential security gaps, duplicated effort

This approach would give teams complete freedom but would result in an inconsistent and potentially insecure API landscape that would be difficult to navigate and maintain.

#### 2. Centralized API Development Team

**Pros**: Maximum consistency, specialized expertise, controlled quality  
**Cons**: Development bottleneck, reduced team ownership, slower delivery

While this would ensure consistency, it would create bottlenecks and reduce the autonomy and ownership of our product teams, contradicting our microservices philosophy.

#### 3. Multiple API Gateways by Domain

**Pros**: Domain isolation, reduced blast radius, team autonomy  
**Cons**: Management complexity, potential inconsistencies, higher operational overhead

This approach offers benefits for large organizations but introduces unnecessary complexity for our current scale. We may revisit this approach as we grow.

#### 4. GraphQL-First Approach

**Pros**: Flexible client queries, reduced over-fetching, schema registry  
**Cons**: Learning curve, performance concerns for some use cases, security complexity

GraphQL offers benefits for certain use cases, but we believe a REST-first approach with GraphQL for specific complex client needs provides a better balance for our organization.
