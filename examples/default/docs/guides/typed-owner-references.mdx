# Typed owner references

Owner references can point to either a user or a team. When both share the same ID, a plain string is ambiguous:

```yaml
owners:
  - john-doe
```

## Use `type|id` for clarity

Use the `type|id` format to specify the owner type:

```yaml
owners:
  - user|john-doe
  - team|platform-team
```

## Backward compatibility

Plain IDs still work and are checked against both users and teams. Use typed references when:

- a user and team share the same ID
- you want explicit, readable intent in metadata

## Versioned references

If you need a version, keep the object format and put `type|id` in the `id` field:

```yaml
owners:
  - id: user|john-doe
    version: 1.0.0
```
