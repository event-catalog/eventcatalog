summary: |
  Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a powerful approach for structuring complex business logic into well-defined services. When designing DDD services, the goal is to align software architecture with business domains, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and scalability. Below is a step-by-step guide to designing effective DDD services.

# 1. Identify Core Domains and Subdomains

Before designing services, understand the business domain by collaborating with domain experts.

* Core Domain: The most critical part of the business (e.g., "Order Processing" in an e-commerce system).

* Supporting Subdomains: Important but not central (e.g., "Billing," "Inventory").

* Generic Subdomains: Common problems with existing solutions (e.g., "Authentication").

Action:

* Conduct Event Storming or Domain Modeling sessions to define key business processes.

* Document Ubiquitous Language (shared terms between developers and business experts).

# 2. Define Bounded Contexts

A **Bounded Context** is a logical boundary where a specific domain model applies.

Example:

* Order Context: Manages orders, payments, and fulfillment.

* Customer Context: Handles user profiles and authentication.

Design Rules:

* Each context should have its own data model and business rules.

* Avoid mixing models from different contexts (e.g., a Customer in the Order Context may only need an ID and Email, not full profile details).

# 3. Design Domain Services

Domain Services encapsulate business logic that doesn’t naturally fit inside an Entity or Value Object.
When to Use a Domain Service?

✅ Cross-Aggregate Logic (e.g., "Process Refund" involving Order and Payment).

✅ External Integrations (e.g., "Fraud Check" calling a third-party API).

✅ Complex Business Rules (e.g., "Discount Calculation" based on multiple factors).

Example:

```java
public class OrderProcessingService {  
    public void fulfillOrder(Order order, InventoryService inventory) {  
        if (inventory.isAvailable(order.getItems())) {  
            order.markAsFulfilled();  
        } else {  
            throw new InsufficientStockException();  
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

Keep services stateless (no internal state).

Avoid anemic services (don’t just move logic from entities into services.)

# Final Checklist for DDD Services

✔ Clear Bounded Contexts (no mixed models).

✔ Rich Domain Models (logic in entities, not services).

✔ Small, Focused Services (single responsibility).

✔ Events for Decoupling (avoid direct dependencies).

✔ CQRS if Needed (optimize reads separately).

# Conclusion

Designing DDD services requires a deep understanding of the business domain, clear boundaries (Bounded Contexts), and proper layering (Domain vs. Application Services). By following these principles, you can build flexible, maintainable systems that evolve with business needs.
