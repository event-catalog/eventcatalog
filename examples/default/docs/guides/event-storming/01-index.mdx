# Introduction to Event Storming

Event Storming is a collaborative modeling technique that helps teams explore complex business domains. It was introduced by Alberto Brandolini and has become a valuable tool in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Event-Driven Architecture (EDA).

## Why Event Storming?

At FlowMart, we use Event Storming because it:

- Brings together domain experts and technical teams
- Helps identify domain events, commands, and aggregates
- Aligns perfectly with our event-driven architecture
- Facilitates better understanding of business processes
- Helps in defining service boundaries and responsibilities

## Example Event Storming Session

Here is an example of an event storming session for the Orders domain.

## Key Concepts

### Domain Events
- Represent something significant that has happened in the business domain
- Written in past tense (e.g., "Order Placed", "Payment Received")
- Captured on orange sticky notes during the session

### Commands
- Triggers that cause domain events
- Written in imperative form (e.g., "Place Order", "Process Payment")
- Captured on blue sticky notes

### Aggregates
- Business entities that ensure consistency
- Group related events and commands
- Captured on yellow sticky notes

### Policies
- Business rules that react to events
- Automated processes or human workflows
- Captured on purple sticky notes

## Event Storming Levels

1. **Big Picture Event Storming**
   - High-level view of the entire business domain
   - Focuses on major events and workflows
   - Helps identify bounded contexts

2. **Process Level Event Storming**
   - Detailed view of specific processes
   - Includes commands, policies, and external systems
   - Helps design individual services

3. **Software Design Level Event Storming**
   - Technical perspective of the domain
   - Includes aggregates, entities, and value objects
   - Leads to implementation decisions

## Benefits for FlowMart

Event Storming has helped us:
- Design our microservices architecture
- Identify service boundaries
- Define event contracts between services
- Improve collaboration between teams
- Reduce misunderstandings and rework

## Prerequisites for Event Storming

To conduct an effective Event Storming session, you'll need:

- A large modeling space (physical or virtual)
- Sticky notes in different colors
- Domain experts and technical team members
- A skilled facilitator
- 2-4 hours of uninterrupted time
