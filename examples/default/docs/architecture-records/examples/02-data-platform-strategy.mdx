## ADR-2023-12: Modern Data Platform Strategy for FinSecure

### Status

Approved (2023-12-18)

### Context

FinSecure is experiencing significant challenges with our current data architecture:

1. **Data Silos**: Customer, transaction, and risk data are siloed across multiple legacy systems with inconsistent data models.

2. **Limited Analytics Capabilities**: Rigid data warehousing solutions limit our ability to perform advanced analytics and machine learning.

3. **Scalability Constraints**: Current data processing infrastructure is struggling to handle increasing data volumes (now exceeding 5TB daily).

4. **Compliance Complexity**: Meeting GDPR, CCPA, and financial regulatory requirements across fragmented data systems is increasingly difficult.

5. **Slow Time-to-Insight**: Business teams wait 2-3 weeks for new analytics dashboards or data models to be developed.

6. **Technical Debt**: Legacy ETL processes are complex, brittle, and expensive to maintain.

7. **Limited Real-time Capabilities**: Current architecture is primarily batch-oriented with limited ability to process streaming data for fraud detection and real-time decisioning.

8. **Data Quality Issues**: Inconsistent data quality across systems impacts business decisions and customer experience.

These challenges are limiting our ability to leverage data as a strategic asset and inhibiting our digital transformation initiatives aimed at enhancing customer experiences and operational efficiency.

### Decision

We will implement a **modern, cloud-based data platform** with a **lakehouse architecture**. Key components include:

1. **Data Lake Foundation**:
   - Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as the foundation for our data lake
   - Databricks Delta Lake for ACID transactions and data reliability
   - Structured organization with bronze (raw), silver (refined), and gold (business) layers

2. **Data Ingestion and Processing**:
   - Azure Data Factory for orchestration and batch data movement
   - Kafka and Azure Event Hubs for real-time data ingestion
   - Databricks for large-scale data processing
   - Stream processing with Spark Structured Streaming

3. **Semantic Layer and Data Serving**:
   - Databricks SQL Warehouses for analytics workloads
   - Azure Synapse Analytics for enterprise data warehousing needs
   - Power BI as primary business intelligence tool
   - REST APIs for serving data to applications

4. **Data Governance and Security**:
   - Azure Purview for data catalog and lineage
   - Column-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Role-based access control aligned with data classification
   - Automated data retention and purging based on policies

5. **Machine Learning Platform**:
   - MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
   - Databricks ML for model development and deployment
   - Model monitoring and retraining pipelines
   - Feature store for reusable feature engineering

6. **DataOps and Automation**:
   - Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
   - CI/CD pipelines for data pipelines and transformations
   - Automated testing for data quality and pipeline integrity
   - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

**Cons**: Limited flexibility, higher long-term costs, limited real-time capabilities

This approach would not address our fundamental needs for real-time processing, advanced analytics, and managing unstructured data.

#### 2. Traditional Data Lake Architecture

**Pros**: Lower cost storage, support for varied data types, scalability  
**Cons**: Complexity in ensuring data quality, limited transactional support, governance challenges

A traditional data lake without the lakehouse capabilities would create significant challenges for data reliability, performance, and governance.

#### 3. Multiple Purpose-Built Systems

**Pros**: Optimized solutions for specific use cases, potentially best-in-class capabilities  
**Cons**: Increased integration complexity, data duplication, inconsistent governance

This approach would perpetuate our data silo issues and create ongoing integration and consistency challenges.

#### 4. Maintain and Incrementally Improve Current Systems

**Pros**: Minimal disruption, lower initial investment, familiar technology  
**Cons**: Perpetuates technical debt, limited capability improvement, increasing maintenance costs

This would fail to address our fundamental challenges and put us at a competitive disadvantage as data volumes and complexity increase.
